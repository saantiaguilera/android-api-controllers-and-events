Android simple controllers and events

As I say in all the things I upload, I wont be putting this license neither making it a private repo. We all start from scratch
and its really helpful (not always, but as long as you learn it) to rely on other tools to make your things easier.

I dont upload this things to maven or jitpack or whatever, I just have it here, 
so feel free to fork it and use it as you want. Please dont sell this on your own or take advantage of it (like saying
you did it), since the point is to use it as a tool or for learning.

If you find an issue or thing that something should be done in some other way, please point me out on it and I will check it!

If you want me to mention your project (if you are using it) tell me also and I will add you here.
